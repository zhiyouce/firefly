    "content": "Hyperledger FireFly v1.1.0 is a feature release that includes significant new functionality around namespaces and plugins, as detailed in FIR-12. As a result, upgrading an existing FireFly environment from any prior release may require special steps (depending on the functionality used). If seamless data preservation is not required, you can simply create a new network from scratch using FireFly v1.1.0. If you want to preserve data from an existing 1.0.x network, significant care has been taken to ensure that it is possible. Most existing environments can be upgraded with minimal extra steps. This document attempts to call out all potentially breaking changes (both common and uncommon), so that you can easily assess the impact of the upgrade and any needed preparation before proceeding.

    "content": "These steps are all safe to do while running FireFly v1.0.x. While they do not have to be done prior to upgrading, performing them ahead of time may allow you to preemptively fix some problems and ease the migration to v1.1.0. Common Steps . Upgrade to latest v1.0.x patch release . Before upgrading to v1.1.0, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to the latest v1.0.x patch release (v1.0.4 as of the writing this document). Do not proceed any further in this guide until all nodes are successfully running the latest patch release version. Fix any deprecated config usage . All items in FireFly’s YAML config that were deprecated at any time in the v1.0.x line will be unsupported in v1.1.0. After upgrading to the latest v1.0.x patch release, you should therefore look for any deprecation warnings when starting FireFly, and ensure they are fixed before upgrading to v1.1.0. Failure to do so will cause your config file to be rejected in v1.1.0, and FireFly will fail to start. You can utilize the ffconfig tool to automatically check and fix deprecated config with a command such as: . ffconfig migrate -f &lt;input-file&gt; -o &lt;output-file&gt; --to 1.0.4 . This should ensure your config file is acceptable to 1.0.x or 1.1.x. Note that if you are attempting to migrate a Dockerized development environment (such as one stood up by the firefly-cli), you may need to edit the config file inside the Docker. Environments created by a v1.0.x CLI do not expose the config file outside the Docker container. Less Common Situations . Record all broadcast namespaces in the config file . Expand for migration details only if your application uses non-default namespaces. FireFly v1.0 allowed for the dynamic creation of new namespaces by broadcasting a namespace definition to all nodes. This functionality is _removed_ in v1.1.0. If your network relies on any namespaces that were created via a broadcast, you must add those namespaces to the `namespaces.predefined` list in your YAML config prior to upgrade. If you do not, they will cease to function after upgrading to v1.1.0 (all events on those namespaces will be ignored by your node). Identify queries for organization/node identities . Expand for migration details only if your application queries /network/organizations or /network/nodes. Applications that query `/network/organizations` or `/network/nodes` will temporarily receive _empty result lists_ after upgrading to v1.1.0, just until all identities have been re-registered (see steps in \"After Upgrading\"). This is because organization and node identities were broadcast on a global \"ff_system\" namespace in v1.0, but are no longer global in v1.1.0. The simplest solution is to shut down applications until the FireFly upgrade is complete on all nodes and all identities have been re-broadcast. If this poses a problem and you require zero downtime from these APIs, you can proactively mitigate with the following steps in your application code: - Applications that query the `/network/organizations` may be altered to _also_ query `/namespaces/ff_system/network/organizations` and combine the results (but should disregard the second query if it fails). - Applications that query the `/network/nodes` may be altered to _also_ query `/namespaces/ff_system/network/nodes` and combine the results (but should disregard the second query if it fails). Further details on the changes to `/network` APIs are provided in the next section. Identify usage of changed APIs . Expand for migration details on all changes to /namespaces, /status, and /network APIs. The primary API change in this version is that the \"global\" paths beginning with `/network` and `/status` have been relocated under the `/namespaces/{ns}` prefix, as this data is now specific to a namespace instead of being global. At the same time, the API server has been enhanced so that omitting a namespace from an API path will _query the default namespace_ instead. That is, querying `/messages` is now the same as querying `/namespaces/default/messages` (assuming your default namespace is named \"default\"). This has the effect that most of the moved APIs will continue to function without requiring changes. See below for details on the affected paths. These global routes have been moved under `/namespaces/{ns}`. Continuing to use them without the namespace prefix **will still work**, and will simply query the default namespace. ``` /network/diddocs/{did} /network/nodes /network/nodes/{nameOrId} /network/nodes/self /network/organizations /network/organizations/{nameOrId} /network/organizations/self /status /status/batchmanager ``` These global routes have been moved under `/namespaces/{ns}` and have also been deprecated in favor of a new route name. Continuing to use them without the namespace prefix **will still work**, and will simply query the default namespace. However, it is recommended to switch to the new API spelling when possible. ``` /network/identities - replaced by existing /namespaces/{ns}/identities /network/identities/{did} - replaced by new /namespaces/{ns}/identities/{did} ``` These global routes have been have been permanently renamed. They are deemed less likely to be used by client applications, but any usage **will be broken** by this release and must be changed after upgrading. ``` /status/pins - moved to /namespaces/{ns}/pins (or /pins to query the default namespace) /status/websockets - moved to /websockets ``` The response bodies of the following APIs have also had fields removed. Any usage of the removed fields **will be broken** by this release and must be changed after upgrading. ``` /namespaces - removed all fields except \"name\", \"description\", \"created\" /namespaces/{ns} - same as above /namespaces/{ns}/status - removed \"defaults\" ``` Adjust or remove usage of admin APIs . Expand for migration details on all changes to /admin and /spi. FireFly provides an administrative API in addition to the normal API. In v1.1.0, this has been renamed to SPI (Service Provider Interface). Consequently, all of the routes have moved from `/admin` to `/spi`, and the config section has been renamed from `admin` to `spi`. There is no automatic migration provided, so any usage of the old routes will need to be changed, and your config file will need to be adjusted if you wish to keep the SPI enabled (although it is perfectly fine to have both `admin` and `spi` sections if needed for migration). The ability to set FireFly config via these routes has also been removed. Any usage of the `/admin/config` routes must be discontinued, and config should be set exclusively by editing the FireFly config file. The only route retained from this functionality was `/admin/config/reset`, which has been renamed to `/spi/reset` - this will continue to be available for performing a soft reset that reloads FireFly's config.

Re-broadcast organization and node identities . Once all nodes in the multiparty network have been upgraded and are running without errors, each node should re-broadcast its org and node identity by invoking /network/organizations/self and /network/nodes/self (or, if your application uses a non-default namespace, by invoking the /namespace/{ns}-prefixed versions of these APIs). This will ensure that queries to /network/organizations and /network/nodes return the expected results, and will register the identities in a way that can be supported by both V1 and V2 multiparty contracts (see “Upgrading the Multi-Party Contract”).

It also introduces a versioning method for this contract, and a path for migrating networks from one contract address to a new one. After upgrading FireFly itself, it is recommended to upgrade your multi-party system to the latest contract version by following these steps. | Compile and deploy an instance of the new FireFly contract (linked above) to your blockchain, using ff deploy or a similar method. | Edit the config file on each node in your network, to add the new contract to the multi-party contract list like so: | . namespaces: predefined: - name: default multiparty: enabled: true contract: - location: address: 0x09f107d670b2e69a700a4d9ef1687490ae1568db - location: address: 0x1bee32b37dc48e99c6b6bf037982eb3bee0e816b . This example assumes 0x09f1... represents the address of the original contract, and 0x1bee... represents the new one. Note that if you have multiple namespaces, you must repeat this step for each namespace in the config - and you must deploy a unique contract instance per namespace (in the new network rules, multiple namespaces cannot share a single contract). | After updating each node’s configuration, restart the node and ensure it starts without issues. | Have any member of the multi-party network invoke the /namespaces/{ns}/network/action FireFly API with a body of {\"type\": \"terminate\"}. This will terminate the old contract and instruct all members to move simultaneously to the newly configured one. | Verify success by querying /namespaces/{ns}/status on each node and checking that the active multi-party contract matches the new address. | .

    "content": "There are quite a few new features around tokens in FireFly v1.2.0. Most notably, FireFly’s token APIs now work with a much wider variety of ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 contracts, supporting variations of these contracts generated by the OpenZepplin Contract Wizard. Sample token contract deprecations . In FireFly v1.2.0 two of the old, lesser used sample token contracts have been deprecated. The ERC20NoData and ERC721NoData contracts have been updated and the previous versions are no longer supported, unless you set the USE_LEGACY_ERC20_SAMPLE=true or USE_LEGACY_ERC721_SAMPLE=true environment variables for your token connector. For more details you can read the description of the pull requests (#104 and #109) where these changes were made. Differences from v1.1.0 . Optional fields . Some token connectors support some optional fields when using them with certain contracts. For example, the ERC-721 token connector supports a URI field. If these optional fields are specified in an API call to a token connector and contract that does not support that field, an error will be returned, rather than the field being silently ignored. Auto incrementing token index . In FireFly v1.2.0 the default ERC-721 and ERC-1155 contracts have changed to automatically increment the token index when a token is minted. This is useful when many tokens may be minted around the same time, or by different minters. This lets the blockchain handle the ordering, and keeping track of the state of which token index should be minted next, rather than making that an application concern. NOTE: These new contracts will only be used for brand new FireFly stacks with v1.2.0. If you have an existing stack, the new token contracts will not be used, unless you specifically deploy them and start using them. ",

Please note that this API only removes data from the FireFly node on which it is called. If data has been shared with other participants of a multi-party network, it is each participants’ responsibility to satisfy their own data retention policies. Differences from v1.1.0 . It is important to note that FireFly now stores a separate copy of a blob for a given payload, even if the same data object is sent in different messages, by different network participants. Previously, in FireFly v1.1.0 the blob was de-duplicated in some cases. In FireFly v1.2.0, deleting the data object will result in each copy of the associated payload being removed. NOTE: If data has been published to IPFS, it cannot be deleted completely.

From the fabconnect project directory, build and tag a new Docker image: . docker build -t ghcr.io/hyperledger/firefly-fabconnect . Edit your manifest.json file . Next, edit the fabconnect section of the manifest.json file.

This is useful for endpoints such as registration, where the client app cannot proceed until the transaction is complete and the member/node is registered.

    "content": "Rapidly accelerating development of applications is a key feature of Hyperledger FireFly. The toolkit is designed to support the full-stack of applications in the enterprise Web3 ecosystem, not just the Smart Contract layer. Business logic APIs, back-office system integrations, and web/mobile user experiences are just as important to the overall Web3 use case. These layers require a different developer skill-set to the on-chain Smart Contracts, and those developers must have the tools they need to work efficiently. API Gateway . FireFly provides APIs that: . | Are fast and efficient | Have rich query support | Give deterministic outcomes and clear instructions for safe use | Integrate with your security frameworks like OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect single sign-on | Provide Open API 3 / Swagger definitions | Come with code SDKs, with rich type information | Conform as closely as possible to the principles of REST | Do not pretend to be RESTful in cases when it is impossible to be | . Learn more about deploying APIs for custom smart contracts in this tutorial . Event Streams . The reality is that the only programming paradigm that works for a decentralized solutions, is an event-driven one. All blockchain technologies are for this reason event-driven programming interfaces at their core. In an overall solution, those on-chain events must be coordinated with off-chain private data transfers, and existing core-systems / human workflows. This means great event support is a must: . | Convenient WebSocket APIs that work for your microservices development stack | Support for Webhooks to integrated serverless functions | Integration with your core enterprise message queue (MQ) or enterprise service bus (ESB) | At-least-once delivery assurance, with simple instructions at the application layer | . Learn all about the Hyperledger FireFly Event Bus, and event-driven application architecture, in this reference section . API Generation . The blockchain is going to be at the heart of your Web3 project. While usually small in overall surface area compared to the lines of code in the traditional application tiers, this kernel of mission-critical code is what makes your solution transformational compared to a centralized / Web 2.0 solution. Whether the smart contract is hand crafted for your project, an existing contract on a public blockchain, or a built-in pattern of a framework like FireFly - it must be interacted with correctly. So there can be no room for misinterpretation in the hand-off between the blockchain Smart Contract specialist, familiar with EVM contracts in Solidity/Vyper, Fabric chaincode (or maybe even raw block transition logic in Rust or Go), and the backend / full-stack application developer / core-system integrator. Well documented APIs are the modern norm for this, and it is no different for blockchain. This means Hyperledger FireFly provides: . | Generating the interface for methods and events on your smart contract | Providing robust transaction submission, and event streaming | Publishing the API, version, and location, of your smart contracts to the network | .

Mount the password hash file in the Docker container . If you set up your FireFly stack using the FireFly CLI we will need to mount the password hash file in the Docker container, so that FireFly can actually read the file. This can be done by editing the docker-compose.override.yml file at: . ~/.firefly/stacks/&lt;stack_name&gt;/docker-compose.override.yml . Edit the file to look like this, replacing the path to your test_users file: . # Add custom config overrides here # See https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends version: \"2.1\" services: firefly_core_0: volumes: - PATH_TO_YOUR_TEST_USERS_FILE:/etc/firefly/test_users . Restart your FireFly Core container . To restart your FireFly stack and have Docker pick up the new volume, run: . ff stop &lt;stack_name&gt; ff start &lt;stack_name&gt; . NOTE: The FireFly basic auth plugin reads this file at startup and will not read it again during runtime. If you add any users or change passwords, restarting the node will be necessary to use an updated file. Test basic auth .

    "content": "A batch bundles a number of off-chain messages, with associated data, into a single payload for broadcast or private transfer. This allows the transfer of many messages (hundreds) to be backed by a single blockchain transaction. Thus making very efficient use of the blockchain. The same benefit also applies to the off-chain transport mechanism. Shared storage operations benefit from the same optimization. In IPFS for example chunks are 256Kb in size, so there is a great throughput benefit in packaging many small messages into a single large payload. For a data exchange transport, there is often cryptography and transport overhead for each individual transport level send between participants. This is particularly true if using a data exchange transport with end-to-end payload encryption, using public/private key cryptography for the envelope.

This “at source” allocation of nonces provides the strictest assurance of order of transactions possible, because the order is locked in with the coordination of the business logic of the application submitting the transaction. As well as protecting against loss of transactions, this protects against duplication of transactions - even in crash recovery scenarios with a sufficiently reliable persistence layer. Avoid multiple nonce management systems against the same signing key . FFTM is optimized for cases where all transactions for a given signing address flow through the same FireFly connector. If you have signing and nonce allocation happening elsewhere, not going through the FireFly blockchain connector, then it is possible that the same nonce will be allocated in two places. Be careful that the signing keys for transactions you stream through the Nonce Management of the FireFly blockchain connector are not used elsewhere. If you must have multiple systems performing nonce management against the same keys you use with FireFly nonce management, you can set the transactions.nonceStateTimeout to 0 (or a low threshold like 100ms) to cause the nonce management to query the pending transaction pool of the node every time a nonce is allocated. This reduces the window for concurrent nonce allocation to be small (basically the same as if you had multiple simple web/mobile wallets used against the same key), but it does not eliminate it completely it. Why “at source” nonce management was chosen vs. “at target” . The “at source” approach to ordering used in FFTM could be compared with the “at target” allocation of nonces used in EthConnect). The “at target” approach optimizes for throughput and ability to send new transactions to the chain, with an at-least-once delivery assurance to the applications. An “at target” algorithm as used in EthConnect could resume transaction delivery automatically without operator intervention from almost all scenarios, including where nonces have been double allocated. However, “at target” comes with two compromises that mean FFTM chose the “at source” approach was chosen for FFTM: . | Individual transactions might fail in certain scenarios, and subsequent transactions will still be streamed to the chain. While desirable for automation and throughput, this reduces the ordering guarantee for high value transactions. | In crash recovery scenarios the assurance is at-least-once delivery for “at target” ordering (rather than “exactly once”), although the window can be made very small through various optimizations included in the EthConnect codebase. | .

It is executed at regular intervals against transactions in-flight, and is responsible for evaluating what actions are required to cause those transactions to be executed successfully. The policy manager can store custom state in the state store of the FFTM code, which is also reported in status within the FireFly API/Explorer on the operation. A reference implementation is provided that: . | Submits transactions via the underlying FFCAPI | Estimates gas price in one of three modes: . | Fixed: It is specified via configuration | Connector: The FFCAPI is used to estimate the gas price (e.g. eth_gasPrice for EVM JSON/RPC) | Gas Oracle: A REST API is called the the result mapped via a Go template | . | Re-submits transactions after a configurable stale time | . The reference implementation is available here . FireFly 1.2 introduced a specification for policy engines to record more detailed information about transaction sub-status and lower-level actions it performs as part of progressing a transaction onto the chain. A policy engine might for example have a sub-status of Received and another sub-status of Tracking. For more information see Blockchain Operation Status . ",

    "content": "One of the largest pieces of heavy lifting code in the FFTM codebase, is the event stream support. This provides a WebSocket (and Webhook) interface that FireFly Core and the Tokens Connectors connect to in order to receive ordered streams of events from the blockchain. The interface down to the blockchain layer is via go channels, and there are lifecycle interactions over the FFCAPI to the blockchain specific code to add and remove listeners for different types of blockchain events. Some high architectural principals that informed the code: . | Event Stream . | A delivery stream of events that have been confirmed | Only events that have reached finality are delivered to an event stream | FireFly creates a single event stream per namespace from core | Each token connector creates a single event stream | If one event stream is blocked, it must not block other streams in the FFTM based runtime | . | Listener (/Subscription) . | A blockchain specific specification for a set of events to listen to | Specifies an initial block to listen from, and will replay all events from that block | Can have multiple blockchain specific filters, to match multiple events | The order of delivery within a listener matches the blockchain across all filters . | Note that the EVMConnect implementation of FFCAPI attempts to make this true across all listeners on an event stream. However, this is impossible when a new listener has been added, and that listener is catching up from an old block. | . | . | Compatibility . | Has breaking changes from the API of EthConnect | A component that has been upgraded to support EVMConnect, can maintain backwards compatibility with EthConnect | . | Batching &amp; Checkpoints . | Delivery on event streams is via batches, with a single confirmation for each batch | At-least-once delivery of batches | Checkpoints are written after each batch | . | Chain head stability . | A configurable section of the head of the chain is considered unstable | If no events have been delivered for a listener, checkpoints are still moved forwards | These empty checkpoints will never be written in the unstable head of the chain | . | Confirmation manager . | Plugged in between detection of the events, and assembling into batches | Determines the final order based on order of confirmation on the blockchain | . | .

The orchestrator in FireFly receives updates from the connector to indicate when the operation has been completed and determine when the FireFly transaction as a whole has finished. These updates must contain enough information to correlate the operation to the FireFly transaction but it can be useful to see more detailed information about how the transaction was processed. FireFly 1.2 introduced the concept of sub-status types that allow a blockchain connector to distinguish between the intermediate steps involved in progressing a transaction. It also introduced the concept of an action which a connector might carry out in order to progress between types of sub-status. This can be described as a state machine as shown in the following diagram: . To access detailed information about a blockchain operation FireFly 1.2 introduced a new query parameter, fetchStatus, to the /transaction/{txid}/operation/{opid} API. When FireFly receives an API request that includes the fetchStatus query parameter it makes a synchronous call directly to the blockchain connector, requesting all of blockchain transaction detail it has. This payload is then included in the FireFly operation response under a new detail field.

The history field is designed to record an ordered list of sub-status changes that the transaction has gone through. Within each sub-status change are the actions that have been carried out to try and move the transaction on to a new sub-status. Some transactions might spend a long time going looping between different sub-status types so this field records the N most recent sub-status changes (where the size of N is determined by blockchain connector and its configuration). The follow example shows a transaction going starting at Received, moving to Tracking, and finally ending up as Confirmed. In order to move from Received to Tracking several actions were performed: AssignNonce, RetrieveGasPrice, and SubmitTransaction.

Because the history field is a FIFO structure describing the N most recent sub-status changes, some early sub-status changes or actions may be lost over time. For example an action of assignNonce might only happen once when the transaction is first processed by the connector. The historySummary field ensures that a minimal set of information is kept about every single subStatus type and action that has been recorded.

    "content": "The data included in broadcasts is not recorded on the blockchain. Instead a pluggable shared storage mechanism is used to contain the data itself. The on-chain transaction just contains a hash of the data that is stored off-chain. This is because the data itself might be too large to be efficiently stored and transferred via the blockchain itself, or subject to deletion at some point in the future through agreement by the members in the network. While the data should be reliably stored with visibility to all members of the network, the data can still be secured from leakage outside of the network. The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is an example of a distributed technology for peer-to-peer storage and distribution of such data in a decentralized multi-party system. It provides secure connectivity between a number of nodes, combined with a decentralized index of data that is available, and native use of hashes within the technology as the way to reference data by content.

If it is, then that message must receive all off-chain private data and be confirmed before any subsequent messages can be confirmed on the same sequence. So if you use the same topic in every message, then a single failed send on one topic blocks delivery of all messages between those parties, until the missing data arrives. Instead it is best practice to set the topic on your messages to a value that identifies an ordered stream of business processing. Some examples: . | A long-running business process instance identifier assigned at initiation | A real-world business transaction identifier used off-chain | The agreed identifier of an asset you are attaching a stream of evidence to | An NFT identifier that is assigned to an asset (digital twin scenarios) | An agreed primary key for a data resource being reconciled between multiple parties | . The topic field is an array, because there are cases (such as merging two identifiers) where you need a message to be deterministically ordered across multiple sequences. However, this is an advanced use case and you are likely to set a single topic on the vast majority of your messages. ",

For more information see the Events reference section. URL . The base path for your Contract API is: . | /api/v1/namespaces/{ns}/apis/{apiName} | . For the default namespace, this can be shortened to: . | /api/v1/apis/{apiName} | . FireFly Interface (FFI) and On-chain Location . Contract APIs are registered against: . | A FireFly Interface (FFI) definition, which defines in a blockchain agnostic format the list of functions/events supported by the smart contract.

    "content": "Data is a uniquely identified piece of data available for retrieval or transfer. Multiple data items can be attached to a message when sending data off-chain to another party in a multi-party system. Note that if you pass data in-line when sending a message, those data elements will be stored separately to the message and available to retrieve separately later. An UUID is allocated to each data resource. A hash is also calculated as follows: . | If there is only data, the hash is of the value serialized as JSON with no additional whitespace (order of the keys is retained from the original upload order). | If there is only a blob attachment, the hash is of the blob data. | There is is both a blob and a value, then the hash is a hash of the concatenation of a hash of the value and a hash of the blob. | . Value - JSON data stored in the core database . Each data resource can contain a value, which is any JSON type. String, number, boolean, array or object. This value is stored directly in the FireFly database. If the value you are storing is not JSON data, but is small enough you want it to be stored in the core database, then use a JSON string to store an encoded form of your data (such as XML, CSV etc.). Datatype - validation of agreed data types . A datatype can be associated with your data, causing FireFly to verify the value against a schema before accepting it (on upload, or receipt from another party in the network). These datatypes are pre-established via broadcast messages, and support versioning. Use this system to enforce a set of common data types for exchange of data across your business network, and reduce the overhead of data verification required in the application/integration tier. More information in the Datatype section . Blob - binary data stored via the Data Exchange . Data resources can also contain a blob attachment, which is stored via the Data Exchange plugin outside of the FireFly core database. This is intended for large data payloads, which might be structured or unstructured. PDF documents, multi-MB XML payloads, CSV data exports, JPEG images video files etc. A Data resource can contain both a value JSON payload, and a blob attachment, meaning that you bind a set of metadata to a binary payload. For example a set of extracted metadata from OCR processing of a PDF document. One special case is a filename for a document. This pattern is so common for file/document management scenarios, that special handling is provided for it. If a JSON object is stored in value, and it has a property called name, then this value forms part of the data hash (as does every field in the value) and is stored in a separately indexed blob.name field. The upload REST API provides an autometa form field, which can be set to ask FireFly core to automatically set the value to contain the filename, size, and MIME type from the file upload.

One party privately sends data to another, over a pipe that has been agreed as sufficiently secure between the two parties.

The ability to perform these same private data exchanges within a multi-party system is critical. In fact it’s common for the majority of business data continue to transfer over such interfaces. So real-time application to application private messaging, and private transfer of large blobs/documents, are first class constructs in the FireFly API. ",

    "content": "FireFly recognizes that a multi-party system will need to establish a secure messaging backbone, with the right qualities of service for their requirements. So the implementation is pluggable, and the plugin interface embraces the following quality of service characteristics that differ between different implementations. | Transport Encryption . | Technologies like TLS encrypt data while it is in flight, so that it cannot be sniffed by a third party that has access to the underlying network. | . | Authentication . | There are many technologies including Mutual TLS, and Java Web Tokens (JWT), that can be used to ensure a private data exchange is happening with the correct party in the system. | Most modern approaches use public/private key encryption to establish the identity during the setup phase of a connection. This means a distribution mechanism is required for public keys, which might be enhanced with a trust hierarchy (like PKI). | . | Request/Response (Sync) vs. Message Queuing (Async) . | Synchronous transports like HTTPS require both parties to be available at the time data is sent, and the transmission must be retried at the application (plugin) layer if it fails or times out. | Asynchronous transports like AMQP, MQTT or Kafka introduce one or more broker runtimes between the parties, that reliably buffer the communications if the target application falls behind or is temporarily unavailable. | . | Hub &amp; spoke vs. Peer to peer . | Connectivity might be direct from one party to another within the network, tackling the IT security complexity of firewalls between sensitive networks. Or network shared infrastructure / as-a-service provider might be used to provide a reliable backbone for data exchange between the members. | . | End-to-end Payload Encryption . | Particularly in cases where the networking hops are complex, or involve shared shared/third-party infrastructure, end-to-end encryption can be used to additionally protect the data while in flight. This technology means data remains encrypted from the source to the target, regardless of the number of transport hops taken in-between. | . | Large blob / Managed file transfer . | The optimal approach to transferring real-time small messages (KBs in size) is different to the approach to transferring large blobs (MBs/GBs in size). For large blobs chunking, compression, and checkpoint restart are common for efficient and reliable transfer. | . | . ",

For example proving total conservation of value in a token trading scenario, without knowing who is involved in the individual transactions. Or providing you have access to a piece of data, without disclosing what that data is. Technologies exist that can solve these requirements, with two major categories: . | Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) . | Advanced cryptography techniques that allow one party to generate a proof that can be be verified by another party, without access to the data used to generate the proof. | . | Trusted Compute Environments (TEEs) . | Secure compute environments that provide proofs of what code was executed, such that other parties can be confident of the logic that was executed without having access to the data. | . | . FireFly today provides an orchestration engine that’s helpful in coordinating the inputs, outputs, and execution of such advanced cryptography technologies. Active collaboration between the FireFly and other projects like Hyperledger Avalon, and Hyperledger Cactus, is evolving how these technologies can plug-in with higher level patterns. ",

    "content": "Enterprise multi-party systems usually operate differently to end-user decentralized applications. In particular, strong identity is established for the organizations that are involved, and those organizations usually sign legally binding commitments around their participation in the network. Those businesses then bring on-board an ecosystem of employees and or customers that are end-users to the system. So the shared source of truth empowered by the blockchain and other cryptography are not the only tools that can be used in the toolbox to ensure correct behavior. Recognizing that there are real legal entities involved, that are mature and regulated, does not undermine the value of the blockchain components. In fact it enhances it. A multi-party system can use just enough of this secret sauce in the right places, to change the dynamics of trust such that competitors in a market are willing to create value together that could never be created before. Or create a system where parties can share data with each other while still conforming to their own regulatory and audit commitments, that previously would have been impossible to share. Not to be overlooked is the sometimes astonishing efficiency increase that can be added to existing business relationships, by being able to agree the order and sequence of a set of events. Having the tools to digitize processes that previously took physical documents flying round the world, into near-immediate digital agreement where the arbitration of a dispute can be resolved at a tiny fraction of what would have been possible without a shared and immutable audit trail of who said what when.

    "content": "Now that you have both FireFly and the FireFly CLI installed, it’s time to create a development stack. The CLI can be used to create a docker-compose environment that runs the entirety of a FireFly network. This will include several different processes for each member of the network. This is very useful for people that want to build apps that use FireFly’s API. It can also be useful if you want to make changes to FireFly itself, however we need to set up the stack slightly differently in that case. Essentially what we are going to do is have docker-compose run everything in the FireFly network except one FireFly core process. We’ll run this FireFly core process on our host machine, and configure it to connect to the rest of the microservices running in docker-compose. This means we could launch FireFly from Visual Studio Code or some other IDE and use a debugger to see what’s going on inside FireFly as it’s running. We’ll call this stack dev. We’re also going to add --external 1 to the end of our command to create the new stack: . ff init dev --external 1 . This tells the CLI that we want to manage one of the FireFly core processes outside the docker-compose stack. For convenience, the CLI will still generate a config file for this process though. Start the stack . To start your new stack simply run: . ff start dev . At a certain point in the startup process, the CLI will pause and wait for up to two minutes for you to start the other FireFly node. There are two different ways you can run the external FireFly core process. 1) From another terminal . The CLI will print out the command line which can be copied and pasted into another terminal window to run FireFly. This command should be run from the firefly core project directory. Here is an example of the command that the CLI will tell you to run: . firefly -f ~/.firefly/stacks/dev/runtime/config/firefly_core_0.yml . NOTE: The first time you run FireFly with a fresh database, it will need a directory of database migrations to apply to the empty database. If you run FireFly from the firefly project directory you cloned from GitHub, it will automatically find these and apply them. If you run it from some other directory, you will have to point FireFly to the migrations on your own. 2) Using an IDE . If you named your stack dev there is a launch.json file for Visual Studio code already in the project directory. If you have the project open in Visual Studio Code, you can either press the F5 key to run it, or go to the “Run and Debug” view in Visual Studio code, and click “Run FireFly Core”. Now you should have a full FireFly stack up and running, and be able to debug FireFly using your IDE. Happy hacking! . NOTE: Because firefly-ui is a separate repo, unless you also start a UI dev server for the external FireFly core, the default UI path will not load. This is expected, and if you’re just working on FireFly core itself, you don’t need to worry about it.` . ",

    "content": "The modelling, transfer and management of digital assets is the core programming foundation of blockchain. Yet out of the box, raw blockchains designed to efficiently manage these assets in large ecosystems, do not come with all the building blocks needed by applications. Token API . Token standards have been evolving in the industry through standards like ERC-20/ERC-721, and the Web3 signing wallets that support these. Hyperledger FireFly bring this same standardization to the application tier. Providing APIs that work across token standards, and blockchain implementations, providing consistent and interoperable support. This means one application or set of back-end systems, can integrate with multiple blockchains, and different token implementations. Pluggability here is key, so that the rules of governance of each digital asset ecosystem can be exposed and enforced. Whether tokens are fungible, non-fungible, or some hybrid in between. Learn more about token standards for fungible tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in this set of tutorials . Transfer history / audit trail . For efficiency blockchains do not provide a direct ability to query historical transaction information. Depending on the blockchain technology, even the current balance of your wallet can be complex to calculate - particularly for blockchain technologies based on an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model. So off-chain indexing of transaction history is an absolute must-have for any digital asset solution. Hyperledger FireFly provides: . | Automatic indexing of tokens, whether existing or newly deployed | Off-chain indexing of fungible and non-fungible asset transfers &amp; balances | Off-chain indexing of approvals | Integration with digital identity | Full extensibility across both token standards and blockchain technologies | . Wallets . Wallet and signing-key management is a critical requirement for any blockchain solution, particularly those involving the transfer of digital assets between wallets. Hyperledger FireFly provides you the ability to: . | Integrate multiple different signing/custody solutions in a proven way | Manage the mapping of off-chain identities to on-chain signing identities | Provide a plug-point for policy-based decision making on high value transactions | Manage connections to multiple different blockchain solutions | .

Import tokens . Metamask won’t know about our custom ERC-721 contract until we give it the Ethereum address for the contract, so that’s what we’ll do next. | Click on Import tokens . | Enter the Ethereum address of the contract | Enter a Token Symbol (can be anything you want) | Click Add Custom Token | .

If you look at the source code for the smart contract we’re working with above, you’ll notice that it emits an event when the stored value of the integer is set. In order to receive these events, we first need to instruct FireFly to listen for this specific type of blockchain event. To do this, we create an Event Listener. The /contracts/listeners endpoint is RESTful so there are POST, GET, and DELETE methods available on it. To create a new listener, we will make a POST request. We are going to tell FireFly to listen to events with name \"Changed\" from the FireFly Interface we defined earlier, referenced by its ID. We will also tell FireFly which contract address we expect to emit these events, and the topic to assign these events to. Topics are a way for applications to subscribe to events they are interested in. Request .

WebSocket event . After creating the subscription, you should see an event arrive on the connected WebSocket client that looks something like this: . { \"id\": \"0f4a31d6-9743-4537-82df-5a9c76ccbd1e\", \"sequence\": 24, \"type\": \"blockchain_event_received\", \"namespace\": \"default\", \"reference\": \"dd3e1554-c832-47a8-898e-f1ee406bea41\", \"created\": \"2022-03-15T17:32:27.824417878Z\", \"blockchainevent\": { \"id\": \"dd3e1554-c832-47a8-898e-f1ee406bea41\", \"sequence\": 7, \"source\": \"ethereum\", \"namespace\": \"default\", \"name\": \"Changed\", \"listener\": \"1bfa3b0f-3d90-403e-94a4-af978d8c5b14\", \"protocolId\": \"000000000010/000000/000000\", \"output\": { \"from\": \"0xb7e6a5eb07a75a2c81801a157192a82bcbce0f21\", \"value\": \"3\" }, \"info\": { \"address\": \"0xa5ea5d0a6b2eaf194716f0cc73981939dca26da1\", \"blockNumber\": \"10\", \"logIndex\": \"0\", \"signature\": \"Changed(address,uint256)\", \"subId\": \"sb-724b8416-786d-4e67-4cd3-5bae4a26eb0e\", \"timestamp\": \"1647365460\", \"transactionHash\": \"0xd5b5c716554097b2868d8705241bb2189bb76d16300f702ad05b0b02fccc4afb\", \"transactionIndex\": \"0x0\" }, \"timestamp\": \"2022-03-15T17:31:00Z\", \"tx\": { \"type\": \"\" } }, \"subscription\": { \"id\": \"f826269c-65ed-4634-b24c-4f399ec53a32\", \"namespace\": \"default\", \"name\": \"simple-storage\" } } . You can see in the event received over the WebSocket connection, the blockchain event that was emitted from our first transaction, which happened in the past. We received this event, because when we set up both the Listener, and the Subscription, we specified the \"firstEvent\" as \"oldest\". This tells FireFly to look for this event from the beginning of the blockchain, and that your app is interested in FireFly events since the beginning of FireFly’s event history. In the event, we can also see the blockchainevent itself, which has an output object. These are the params in our FireFly Interface, and the actual output of the event. Here we can see the value is 3 which is what we set the integer to in our original transaction. Subscription offset . If you query by the ID of your subscription with the fetchstatus parameter, you can see its current offset.

    "title": "Event",
    "content": "Every Event emitted by FireFly shares a common structure. See Events for a reference for how the overall event bus in Hyperledger FireFly operates, and descriptions of all the sub-categories of events. Sequence . A local sequence number is assigned to each event, and you can use an API to query events using this sequence number in exactly the same order that they are delivered to your application. Reference . Events have a reference to the UUID of an object that is the subject of the event, such as a detailed Blockchain Event, or an off-chain Message. When events are delivered to your application, the reference field is automatically retrieved and included in the JSON payload that is delivered to your application. You can use the ?fetchreferences query parameter on API calls to request the same in-line JSON payload be included in query results. The type of the reference also determines what subscription filters apply when performing server-side filters. Here is the mapping between event types, and the object that you find in the reference field. Correlator . For some event types, there is a secondary reference to an object that is associated with the event. This is set in a correlator field on the Event, but is not automatically fetched. This field is primarily used for the confirm option on API calls to allow FireFly to determine when a request has succeeded/failed. Topic . Events have a topic, and how that topic is determined is specific to the type of event. This is intended to be a property you would use to filter events to your application, or query all historical events associated with a given business data stream. For example when you send a Message, you set the topics you want that message to apply to, and FireFly ensures a consistent global order between all parties that receive that message. Transaction . When actions are submitted by a FireFly node, they are performed within a FireFly Transaction. The events that occur as a direct result of that transaction, are tagged with the transaction ID so that they can be grouped together. This construct is a distinct higher level construct than a Blockchain transaction, that groups together a number of operations/events that might be on-chain or off-chain. In some cases, such as unpinned off-chain data transfer, a FireFly transaction can exist when there is no blockchain transaction at all. Wherever possible you will find that FireFly tags the FireFly transaction with any associated Blockchain transaction(s). Note that some events cannot be tagged with a Transaction ID: . | Blockchain events, unless they were part of a batch-pin transaction for transfer of a message | Token transfers/approvals, unless they had a message transfer associated with them (and included a data payload in the event they emitted) | . Reference, Topic and Correlator by Event Type . | Types | Reference | Topic | Correlator | . | transaction_submitted | Transaction | transaction.type |   | . | message_confirmedmessage_rejected | Message | message.header.topics[i]* | message.header.cid | . | token_pool_confirmed | TokenPool | tokenPool.id |   | . | token_pool_op_failed | Operation | tokenPool.id | tokenPool.id | . | token_transfer_confirmed | TokenTransfer | tokenPool.id |   | . | token_transfer_op_failed | Operation | tokenPool.id | tokenTransfer.localId | . | token_approval_confirmed | TokenApproval | tokenPool.id |   | . | token_approval_op_failed | Operation | tokenPool.id | tokenApproval.localId | . | namespace_confirmed | Namespace | \"ff_definition\" |   | . | datatype_confirmed | Datatype | \"ff_definition\" |   | . | identity_confirmedidentity_updated | Identity | \"ff_definition\" |   | . | contract_interface_confirmed | FFI | \"ff_definition\" |   | . | contract_api_confirmed | ContractAPI | \"ff_definition\" |   | . | blockchain_event_received | BlockchainEvent | From listener ** |   | . | blockchain_invoke_op_succeeded | Operation |   |   | . | blockchain_invoke_op_failed | Operation |   |   | . | blockchain_contract_deploy_op_succeeded | Operation |   |   | . | blockchain_contract_deploy_op_failed | Operation |   |   | . | A separate event is emitted for each topic associated with a Message. | . ** The topic for a blockchain event is inherited from the blockchain listener, allowing you to create multiple blockchain listeners that all deliver messages to your application on a single FireFly topic.

    "content": "Decentralized applications are built around a source of truth that is shared between multiple parties. No one party can change the state unilaterally, as their changes need to be processed in order with the other changes in the system. Each party processes requests to change shared state in the same order, against a common set of rules for what is allowed at that exact point in the processing. As a result everybody deterministically ends up with the same state at the end of the processing. This requires an event-driven programming model. You will find an event-driven model at the core of every blockchain Smart Contract technology. This event-driven approach is unavoidable regardless of how much of your business data &amp; logic can be directly stored/processed on-chain, vs. off-chain. So Hyperledger FireFly aims to provide you with the tools to easily manage this model throughout your decentralized application stack. Your back-end application should be structured for this event-driven paradigm, with an Event Handler constantly listening for events, applying a consistent State Machine to those events and applying the changes to your Application Database. FireFly comes with a built in event processor for Token transfers &amp; approvals, that implements this pattern to maintain balances, and transaction history in a rich query off-chain data cache. ",

    "content": "In a decentralized system, you need to consider that each organization runs its own applications, and has its own private database. At any given point in time different organizations will have slightly different views of what the most up to date information is - even for the blockchain state. As well as the agreed business logic, there will be private data and core system integration that are needed to process events as they happen. Some of this data might be received privately from other parties, over a secure communications channel (not the blockchain). The system must be eventually consistent across all parties for any business data/decision that those parties need to agree on. This happens by all parties processing the same events in the same order, and by applying the same business logic (for the parts of the business logic that are agreed). This means that when processing an event, a participant must have access to enough historical data/state to reach the same conclusion as everyone else. Let’s look at a couple of examples. Example 1: A fungible token balance transfer . You need to be able to verify the complete lineage of the tokens being spent, in order to know that they cannot be double spent anywhere in the network. This means the transaction must be backed by a blockchain verifiable by all participants on the network that could hold balances of that token. You might be able to use advanced cryptography (such as zero-knowledge proofs) to mask the participants in the trade, but the transaction themselves must be verifiable to everyone in a global sequence that prevents double spending. Example 2: A step in a multi-party business process . Here it is likely you want to restrict visibility of the data to just the parties directly involved in the business process. To come to a common agreement on outcome, the parties must know they are processing the same data in the same order. So at minimum a proof (a hash of the data) needs to “pinned” to a blockchain ledger visible to all participants involved in the process. You can then choose to put more processing on the blockchain, to enforce some critical rules in the business state machine that must be executed fairly to prevent one party from cheating the system. Such as that the highest bid is chosen in a competitive bidding process, or a minimum set of parties have voted agreement before a transaction is finalized. Other steps in the process might include human decision making, private data from the core systems of one member, or proprietary business logic that one member is not willing to share. These steps are “non-deterministic” - you cannot predict the outcome, nor be guaranteed to reproduce the same outcome with the same inputs in the future. The FireFly event bus is designed to make triggering these non-deterministic steps easy, while still allowing them to be part of the overall state machine of the business process. You need to take care that the system is designed so parties cannot cheat, and must follow the rules. How much of that rule enforcement needs to be executed on-chain vs. off-chain (backed by a deterministic order through the blockchain) is different for each use case. Remember that tokens provide a great set of building blocks for on-chain steps in your decentralized applications. Enterprise NFTs allow generation of a globally unique ID, and track ownership. Fungible tokens allow value transfer, and can be extended with smart contracts that to lock/unlock funds in “digital escrow” while complex off-chain agreement happens. ",

    "content": "If a new participant needs to join into a business transaction that has already started, they must first “catch up” with the current state before they can play their part. In a real-world scenario they might not be allowed to see all the data that’s visible to the other parties, so it is common to create a new stream of communications that includes all of the existing parties, plus the new party, to continue the process. If you use the same blockchain to back both groups, then you can safely order business process steps that involve different parties across these overlapping groups of participants. Using a single Ethereum permissioned side-chain for example. Alternatively, you can create dedicated distributed ledgers (DLTs) for communication between these groups of participants. This can allow more logic and data to go on-chain directly, although you still must consider the fact that this data is immutable and can never be deleted. Using Hyperledger Fabric channels for example. On top of either type of ledger, FireFly provides a private Group construct to facilitate secure off-chain data exchanges, and to efficiently pin these communications to the blockchain in batches. These private data exchanges can also be coordinated with most sophisticated on-chain transactions, such as token transfers. ",

    "content": "FireFly provides a number of different types of events to your application, designed to allow you to build your application state machine quickly and reliably. All events in FireFly share a common base structure, regardless of their type. They are then linked (via a reference) to an object that contains detailed information. The categories of event your application can receive are as follows: . See the Core Resources/Event page for a full list of event types, and more details on the data you can expect for each type. Blockchain events . FireFly allows your application to subscribe to any event from a blockchain smart contract. In order for applications connected to the FireFly API to receive blockchain events from a smart contracts, a ContractListener fist must be created to instruct FireFly to listen to those events from the blockchain (via the blockchain plugin). Once you have configured the blockchain event listener, every event detected from the blockchain will result in a FireFly event delivered to your application of type blockchain_event_received. Check out the Custom Contracts Tutorial for a walk-through of how to set up listeners for the events from your smart contracts. FireFly automatically establishes listeners for some blockchain events: . | Events from the FireFly BatchPin contract that is used to pin identities, off-chain data broadcast and private messaging to the blockchain. | Events from Token contracts, for which a Token Pool has been configured. These events are detected indirectly via the token connector. | . Token events . FireFly provides a Wallet API, that is pluggable to multiple token implementations without needing to change your app. The pluggable API/Event interface allows all kinds of technical implementations of tokens to be fitted into a common framework. The following wallet operations are supported. These are universal to all token implementations - NFTs and fungible tokens alike: . | Mint | Burn | Transfer | Approve | . FireFly processes, indexes and stores the events associated with these actions, for any Token Pool that has been configured on the FireFly node. See Token Transfer and Token Approval for more information on the individual operations. The token connector is responsible for mapping from the raw Blockchain Events, to the FireFly model for tokens. Reference token connector implementations are provided for common interface standards implemented by tokens - like ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-115. A particular token contract might have many additional features that are unique to that contract, particularly around governance. For these you would use the Smart Contract features of FireFly to interact with the blockchain API and Events directly. ",

The universal order and additional transaction logic on-chain must be the source of truth for when and how an event is processed. However, that event cannot be processed until the off-chain private/broadcast data associated with that event is also available and verified against the on-chain hash of that additional data. They might arrive in any order, and no further events can be processed on that business transaction until the data is available. Multiple parties might be emitting events as part of the business transaction, and the outcome will only be assured to be the same by all parties if they process these events in the same order. Hyperledger FireFly handles this for you. Events related to a message are not emitted until both the on-chain and off-chain parts (including large binary attachments) are available+verified in your local FireFly node, and all previous messages on the same topic have been processed successfully by your application.

While Ethereum (or other EVM based blockchains) requires an Application Binary Interface (ABI) to govern the interaction between the client and the smart contract, which is specific to each smart contract interface design, Fabric defines a generic chaincode interface and leaves the encoding and decoding of the parameter values to the discretion of the chaincode developer. As a result, the FFI document for a Fabric chaincode must be hand-crafted. The following FFI sample demonstrates the specification for the following common cases: . | structured JSON, used here for the list of chaincode function CreateAsset input parameters | array of JSON, used here for the chaincode function GetAllAssets output | structured JSON, used here for the list of chaincode event AssetCreated properties | . { \"namespace\": \"default\", \"name\": \"asset_transfer\", \"description\": \"Spec interface for the asset-transfer-basic golang chaincode\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"methods\": [ { \"name\": \"GetAllAssets\", \"pathname\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"params\": [], \"returns\": [ { \"name\": \"\", \"schema\": { \"type\": \"array\", \"details\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } } } ] }, { \"name\": \"CreateAsset\", \"pathname\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"params\": [ { \"name\": \"id\", \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }, { \"name\": \"color\", \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }, { \"name\": \"size\", \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }, { \"name\": \"owner\", \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }, { \"name\": \"value\", \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } ], \"returns\": [] } ], \"events\": [ { \"name\": \"AssetCreated\" } ] } . Input parameters . For the params section of the CreateAsset function, it is critical that the sequence of the properties (id, color, size, owner, value) matches the order of the input parameters in the chaincode’s function signature: . func CreateAsset(ctx contractapi.TransactionContextInterface, id string, color string, size int, owner string, appraisedValue int) error . Return values . FireFly can automatically decode JSON payloads in the return values. That’s why the returns section of the GetAllAssets function only needs to specify the type as array of objects, without having to specify the detailed structure of the JSON payload. On the other hand, if certain properties of the returned value are to be hidden, then you can provide a detailed structure of the JSON object with the desired properties. This is demonstrated in the JSON structure for the event payload, see below, where the property AppraisedValue is omitted from the output. Event payloads . For events, FireFly automatically decodes JSON payloads. If the event payload is not JSON, base64 encoded bytes will be returned instead. For the events section of the FFI, only the name property needs to be specified. ",

If you look at the source code for the smart contract we’re working with above, you’ll notice that it emits an event when a new asset is created. In order to receive these events, we first need to instruct FireFly to listen for this specific type of blockchain event. To do this, we create an Event Listener. The /contracts/listeners endpoint is RESTful so there are POST, GET, and DELETE methods available on it. To create a new listener, we will make a POST request. We are going to tell FireFly to listen to events with name \"AssetCreated\" from the FireFly Interface we defined earlier, referenced by its ID. We will also tell FireFly which channel and chaincode we expect to emit these events. Request .

We’re also going to set up a filter to only send events blockchain events from our listener that we created in the previous step. To do that, we’ll copy the listener ID from the step above (6e7f5dd8-5a57-4163-a1d2-5654e784dc31) and set that as the value of the listener field in the example below: . Request .

You can see in the event received over the WebSocket connection, the blockchain event that was emitted from our first transaction, which happened in the past. We received this event, because when we set up both the Listener, and the Subscription, we specified the \"firstEvent\" as \"oldest\". This tells FireFly to look for this event from the beginning of the blockchain, and that your app is interested in FireFly events since the beginning of FireFly’s event history. In the event, we can also see the blockchainEvent itself, which has an output object. This contains the event payload that was set by the chaincode. ",

    "content": "fftokens is a protocol that can be implemented by token connector runtimes in order to be usable by the fftokens plugin in FireFly. The connector runtime must expose an HTTP and websocket server, along with a minimum set of HTTP APIs and websocket events. Each connector will be strongly coupled to a specific ledger technology and token standard(s), but no assumptions are made in the fftokens spec about what these technologies must be, as long as they can satisfy the basic requirements laid out here. Note that this is an internal protocol in the FireFly ecosystem - application developers working against FireFly should never need to care about or directly interact with a token connector runtime. The audience for this document is only developers interested in creating new token connectors (or editing/forking existing ones). Two implementations of this specification have been created to date (both based on common Ethereum token standards) - firefly-tokens-erc1155 and firefly-tokens-erc20-erc721. ",

    "title": "HTTP APIs",
    "content": "This is the minimum set of APIs that must be implemented by a conforming token connector. A connector may choose to expose other APIs for its own purposes. All requests and responses to the APIs below are encoded as JSON. The APIs are currently understood to live under a /api/v1 prefix. POST /createpool . Create a new token pool. The exact meaning of this is flexible - it may mean invoking a contract or contract factory to actually define a new set of tokens via a blockchain transaction, or it may mean indexing a set of tokens that already exists (depending on the options a connector accepts in config). In a multiparty network, this operation will only be performed by one of the parties, and FireFly will broadcast the result to the others. FireFly will store a “pending” token pool after a successful creation, but will replace it with a “confirmed” token pool after a successful activation (see below). Request . { \"type\": \"fungible\", \"signer\": \"0x0Ef1D0Dd56a8FB1226C0EaC374000B81D6c8304A\", \"name\": \"FFCoin\", \"symbol\": \"FFC\", \"data\": \"pool-metadata\", \"requestId\": \"1\", \"config\": {} } . | Parameter | Type | Description | . | type | string enum | The type of pool to create. Currently supported types are “fungible” and “nonfungible”. It is recommended (but not required) that token connectors support both. Unrecognized/unsupported types should be rejected with HTTP 400. | . | signer | string | The signing identity to be used for the blockchain transaction, in a format understood by this connector. | . | name | string | (OPTIONAL) If supported by this token contract, this is a requested name for the token pool. May be ignored at the connector’s discretion. | . | symbol | string | (OPTIONAL) If supported by this token contract, this is a requested symbol for the token pool. May be ignored at the connector’s discretion. | . | requestId | string | (OPTIONAL) A unique identifier for this request. Will be included in the “receipt” websocket event to match receipts to requests. | . | data | string | (OPTIONAL) A data string that should be returned in the connector’s response to this creation request. | . | config | object | (OPTIONAL) An arbitrary JSON object where the connector may accept additional parameters if desired. Each connector may define its own valid options to influence how the token pool is created. | . Response . HTTP 200: pool creation was successful, and the pool details are returned in the response. See Response Types: Token Pool . HTTP 202: request was accepted, but pool will be created asynchronously, with “receipt” and “token-pool” events sent later on the websocket. See Response Types: Async Request . POST /activatepool . Activate a token pool to begin receiving events. Generally this means the connector will create blockchain event subscriptions to transfer and approval events related to the set of tokens encompassed by this token pool. In a multiparty network, this step will be performed by every member after a successful token pool broadcast. It therefore also serves the purpose of validating the broadcast info - if the connector does not find a valid pool given the poolLocator and config information passed in to this call, the pool should not get confirmed. Request . { \"poolLocator\": \"id=F1\", \"poolData\": \"extra-pool-info\", \"requestId\": \"1\", \"config\": {} } . | Parameter | Type | Description | . | poolLocator | string | The locator of the pool, as supplied by the output of the pool creation. | . | poolData | string | (OPTIONAL) A data string that should be permanently attached to this pool and returned in all events. | . | requestId | string | (OPTIONAL) A unique identifier for this request. Will be included in the “receipt” websocket event to match receipts to requests. | . | config | object | (OPTIONAL) An arbitrary JSON object where the connector may accept additional parameters if desired. This should be the same config object that was passed when the pool was created. | . Response . HTTP 200: pool activation was successful, and the pool details are returned in the response. See Response Types: Token Pool . HTTP 202: request was accepted, but pool will be activated asynchronously, with “receipt” and “token-pool” events sent later on the websocket. See Response Types: Async Request . HTTP 204: activation was successful - no separate receipt will be delivered, but “token-pool” event will be sent later on the websocket. No body . POST /checkinterface . This is an optional (but recommended) API for token connectors. If implemented, support will be indicated by the presence of the interfaceFormat field in all Token Pool responses. In the case that a connector supports multiple variants of a given token standard (such as many different ways to structure “mint” or “burn” calls on an underlying smart contract), this API allows the connector to be provided with a full description of the interface methods in use for a given token pool, so the connector can determine which methods it knows how to invoke. Request . { \"poolLocator\": \"id=F1\", \"format\": \"abi\", \"methods\": [ { \"name\": \"burn\", \"type\": \"function\", \"inputs\": [ { \"internalType\": \"uint256\", \"name\": \"tokenId\", \"type\": \"uint256\" } ], \"outputs\": [], \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\" }, ... ] } . | Parameter | Type | Description | . | poolLocator | string | The locator of the pool, as supplied by the output of the pool creation. | . | format | string enum | The format of the data in this payload. Should match the interfaceFormat as supplied by the output of the pool creation. | . | methods | object array | A list of all the methods available on the interface underpinning this token pool, encoded in the format specified by format. | . Response . HTTP 200: interface was successfully parsed, and methods of interest are returned in the body. The response body includes a section for each type of token operation (burn/mint/transfer/approval), which specifies a subset of the input body useful to that operation. The caller (FireFly) can then store and provide the proper subset of the interface for every future token operation (via the interface parameter). { \"burn\": { \"format\": \"abi\", \"methods\": [ { \"name\": \"burn\", \"type\": \"function\", \"inputs\": [ { \"internalType\": \"uint256\", \"name\": \"tokenId\", \"type\": \"uint256\" } ], \"outputs\": [], \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\" } ] }, \"mint\": { ... }, \"transfer\": { ... }, \"approval\": { ... } } .

Schema . The param schema is an important field which tells FireFly the type information about this particular field. This is used in several different places, such as OpenAPI Spec generation, API request validation, and blockchain request preparation. The schema field accepts JSON Schema (version 2020-12) with several additional requirements: . | A type field is always mandatory | The list of valid types is: . | boolean | integer | string | object | array | . | Blockchain plugins can add their own specific requirements to this list of validation rules | .

    "title": "Data flow",
    "content": "The reality of most Web3 scenarios is that only a small part of the overall use-case can be represented inside the blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Some additional data flow is always required. This does not diminish the value of executing the kernel of the logic within the blockchain itself. Hyperledger FireFly embraces this reality, and allows an organization to keep track of the relationship between the off-chain data flow, and the on-chain transactions. Let’s look at a few common examples: . Digital Asset Transfers . Examples of common data flows performed off-chain, include Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) checks that need to be performed and validated before participating in transactions. There might also be document management and business transaction flows required to verify the conditions are correct to digitally settle a transaction. Have the goods been delivered? Are the contracts in place? . In regulated enterprise scenarios it is common to see a 10-to-1 difference in the number of steps performed off-chain to complete a business transaction, vs. the number of steps performed on-chain. These off-chain data flows might be coordinated with on-chain smart contracts that lock assets in digital escrow until the off-chain steps are completed by each party, and protect each party while the steps are being completed. A common form of digital escrow is a Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC). Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) and hash-pinning . The data associated with an NFT might be as simple as a JSON document pointing at an interesting piece of artwork, or as complex a set of high resolution scans / authenticity documents representing a digital twin of a real world object. Here the concept of a hash pinning is used - allowing anyone who has a copy of the original data to recreate the hash that is stored in the on-chain record. With even the simplest NFT the business data is not stored on-chain, so simple data flow is always required to publish/download the off-chain data. The data might be published publicly for anyone to download, or it might be sensitive and require a detailed permissioning flow to obtain it from a current holder of that data. Dynamic NFTs and Business Transaction Flow . In an enterprise context, an NFT might have a dynamic ever-evolving trail of business transaction data associated with it. Different parties might have different views of that business data, based on their participation in the business transactions associated with it. Here the NFT becomes a like a foreign key integrated across the core systems of a set of enterprises working together in a set of business transactions. The data itself needs to be downloaded, retained, processed and rendered. Probably integrated to systems, acted upon, and used in multiple exchanges between companies on different blockchains, or off-chain. The business process is accelerated through this Enterprise NFT on the blockchain - as all parties have matched or bound their own private data store to that NFT. This means they are confident to be executing a business transaction against the same person or thing in the world. Data and Transaction Flow patterns . Hyperledger FireFly provides the raw tools for building data and transaction flow patterns, such as storing, hashing and transferring data. It provides the event bus to trigger off-chain applications and integration to participate in the flows. It also provides the higher level flow capabilities that are needed for multiple parties to build sophisticated transaction flows together, massively simplifying the application logic required: . | Coordinating the transfer of data off-chain with a blockchain sequencing transaction | Batching for high throughput transfer via the blockchain and distributed storage technologies | Managing privacy groups between parties involved in a business transaction | Masking the relationship between blockchain transactions, for sensitive data | .

Instead their core function is to provide an ordered ledger of actions+events, along with a consistent world state at any point in time. This means that almost all user experiences and business APIs need a separate data store, that provides an fast indexed view of the history and current state of the chain. As an example, you’ve probably looked at a Block Explorer for a public blockchain on the web. Well, you weren’t looking directly at the blockchain node. You were querying an off-chain indexed database, of all the blocks and transactions on that chain. An indexer behind the scenes was listening to the blockchain and synchronizing the off-chain state. Hyperledger FireFly has a built-in indexer for tokens, that maps every token mint/burn/transfer/approve operation that happens on the the blockchain into the database for fast query. You just specify which tokens you’re interested in, and FireFly takes care of the rest. Additionally, FireFly does the heavy lifting part of indexing for all other types of smart contract event that might occur. It scrapes the blockchain for the events, formats them into easy to consume JSON, and reliably delivers them to your application. So your application just needs a small bit of code to take those payloads, and insert them into the database with the right database indexes you need to query your data by. ",

As a publisher or consumer of such metadata from decentralized storage, you need to be confident you have your own copy safe. So just like with the blockchain data, Hyperledger FireFly can act as a staging post for this data. Structured JSON data can be stored, uploaded and downloaded from the FireFly database. Large image/document/video payloads are handled by the pluggable Data Exchange microservice, which allows you to attach local or cloud storage to manage your copy of the data. FireFly then provides a standardized API to allow publishing of this data.

    "content": "A privacy group is a list of identities that should receive a private communication. When you send a private message, you can specify the list of participants in-line and it will be resolved to a group. Or you can reference the group using its identifying hash. The sender of a message must be included in the group along with the other participants. The sender receives an event confirming the message, just as any other participant would do. The sender is included automatically in the group when members are specified in-line, if it is omitted. Group identity hash . The identifying hash for a group is determined as follows: . | All identities are resolved to their DID. | An organization name or identity UUID can be used on input | . | The UUID of the node that should receive the data for each participant is determined (if not specified). | The first node found that is in the same identity hierarchy as the participant identity, will be chosen. | . | The list of participants is ordered by DID, with de-duplication of any identities. | The namespace, name, and members array are then serialized into a JSON object, without whitespace. | A SHA256 hash of the JSON object is calculated | . Private messaging architecture . The mechanism that keeps data private and ordered, without leaking data to the blockchain, is summarized in the below diagram. The key points are: . | Data is sent off-chain to all participants via the Data Exchange plugin . | The Data Exchange is responsible for encryption and off-chain identity verification | . | Only parties that are involved in the privacy group receive the data . | Other parties are only able to view the blockchain transaction | . | The hash and member list of the group are not shared outside of the privacy group . | The name of the group can be used as an additional salt in generation of the group hash | The member list must be known by all members of the group to verify the blockchain transactions, so the full group JSON structure is communicated privately with the first message sent on a group | . | The blockchain transaction is the source of truth for ordering . | All members are able to detect a blockchain transaction is part of a group they are a member of, from only the blockchain transaction - so they can block processing of subsequent messages until the off-chain data arrives (asynchronously) | . | The ordering context for messages is masked on the blockchain, so that two messages that are for same group do not contain the same context . | The ordering context (topic+group) is combined with a nonce that is incremented for each individual sender, to form a message-specific hash. | For each blockchain transaction, this hash can be compared against the expected next hash for each member to determine if it is a message on a known group - even without the private data (which might arrive later) | . | .

The claim data consists of information on the identity being claimed - such as the type, the DID, and the parent (if applicable). The DID must be unique and unclaimed. The verifier will be inferred from the message - for on-chain identities (org and custom), it is the blockchain key that was used to sign the on-chain portion of the message, while for off-chain identities (nodes), is is an identifier queried from data exchange.

See FIR-12 for evolution that is happening to Hyperledger FireFly to allow: . | Private address books that are not shared with other participants | Multiple address books backed by different chains, in the same node | . Root identities are registered with only a claim - which is a signed transaction from a particular blockchain account, to bind a DID with a name that is unique within the network, to that signing key. The signing key then becomes a Verifier for that identity. Using that key the root identity can be used to register a new FireFly node in the network, send and receive messages, and register child identities. When child identities are registered, a claim using a key that is going to be the Verifier for that child identity is required. However, this is insufficient to establish that identity as a child identity of the parent. There must be an additional verification that references the claim (by UUID) using the key verifier of the parent identity. DIDs . FireFly has adopted the DID standard for representing identities. A “DID Method” name of firefly is used to represent that the built-in identity system of Hyperledger FireFly is being used to resolve these DIDs. So an example FireFly DID for organization abcd1234 is: . | did:firefly:org/abcd1234 | . The adoption of DIDs in Hyperledger FireFly v1.0 is also a stepping stone to allowing pluggable DID based identity resolvers into FireFly in the future.

    "content": "FireFly defines the following constructs to support custom smart contracts: . | Contract Interface: FireFly defines a common, blockchain agnostic way to describe smart contracts. This is referred to as a Contract Interface. A contract interface is written in the FireFly Interface (FFI) format. It is a simple JSON document that has a name, a namespace, a version, a list of methods, and a list of events. | . For more details, you can also have a look at the Reference page for the FireFly Interface Format. For blockchains that offer a DSL describing the smart contract interface, such as Ethereum’s ABI (Application Binary Interface), FireFly offers a convenience tool to convert the DSL into the FFI format. NOTE: Contract interfaces are scoped to a namespace. Within a namespace each contract interface must have a unique name and version combination. The same name and version combination can exist in different namespaces simultaneously. | HTTP API: Based on a Contract Interface, FireFly further defines an HTTP API for the smart contract, which is complete with an OpenAPI Specification and the Swagger UI. An HTTP API defines an /invoke root path to submit transactions, and a /query root path to send query requests to read the state back out. | . How the invoke vs. query requests get interpreted into the native blockchain requests are specific to the blockchain’s connector. For instance, the Ethereum connector translates /invoke calls to eth_sendTransaction JSON-RPC requests, while /query calls are translated into eth_call JSON-RPC requests. One the other hand, the Fabric connector translates /invoke calls to the multiple requests required to submit a transaction to a Fabric channel (which first collects endorsements from peer nodes, and then sends the assembled transaction payload to an orderer, for details please refer to the Fabric documentation). | Blockchain Event Listener: Regardless of a blockchain’s specific design, transaction processing are always asynchronous. This means a transaction is submitted to the network, at which point the submitting client gets an acknowledgement that it has been accepted for further processing. The client then listens for notifications by the blockchain when the transaction gets committed to the blockchain’s ledger. | . FireFly defines event listeners to allow the client application to specify the relevant blockchain events to keep track of. A client application can then receive the notifications from FireFly via an event subscription. | Event Subscription: While an event listener tells FireFly to keep track of certain events emitted by the blockchain, an event subscription tells FireFly to relay those events to the client application. Each subscriptions represents a stream of events that can be delivered to a listening client with various modes of delivery with at-least-once delivery guarantee. | . This is exactly the same as listening for any other events from FireFly. For more details on how Subscriptions work in FireFly you can read the Getting Started guide to Listen for events. ",

Here are some other suggestions of places to get started, based on experience you may already have: . Any level of experience . If you looking to make your first open source contribution the FireFly documentation is a great place to make small, easy improvements. These improvements are also very valuable, because they help the next person that may want to know the same thing. Here are some detailed instructions on Contributing to Documentation . Go experience . If you have some experience in Go and really want to jump into FireFly, the FireFly Core is the heart of the project. Here are some detailed instructions on Setting up a FireFly Core Development Environment. Little or no Go experience, but want to learn . If you don’t have a lot of experience with Go, but are interested in learning, the FireFly CLI might be a good place to start. The FireFly CLI is a tool to set up local instances of FireFly for building apps that use FireFly, and for doing development on FireFly itself. TypeScript experience . If you have some experience in TypeScript, there are several FireFly microservices that are written in TypeScript. The Data Exchange is used for private messaging between FireFly nodes. The ERC-20/ERC-271 Tokens Connector and ERC-1155 Tokens Connector are used to abstract token contract specifics from the FireFly Core. React/TypeScript experience . If you want to do some frontend development, the FireFly UI is written in TypeScript and React. Go and blockchain experience . If you already have some experience with blockchain and want to work on some backend components, the blockchain connectors, firefly-ethconnect (for Ethereum) and firefly-fabconnect (for Fabric) are great places to get involved.

One of the most important roles FireFly has, is to take actions being performed by the local apps, process them, get them confirmed, and then deliver back as “stream of consciousness” to the application alongside all the other events that are coming into the application from other FireFly Nodes in the network. You might observe the problems solved in this architecture are similar to those in a message queuing system (like Apache Kafka, or a JMS/AMQP provider like ActiveMQ etc.). However, we cannot directly replace the internal logic with such a runtime - because FireFly’s job is to aggregate data from multiple runtimes that behave similarly to these: . | Private messaging in the Data Exchange | The blockchain ledger(s) themselves, which are a stream of sequenced events | The event dispatcher delivering messages to applications that have been sequenced by FireFly | . So FireFly provides the convenient REST based management interface to simplify the world for application developers, by aggregating the data from multiple locations, and delivering it to apps in a deterministic sequence. The sequence is made deterministic: . | Globally to all apps within the scope of the ledger, when a Blockchain ledger is used to pin events (see #10) | Locally for messages delivered through a single FireFly node into the network | Locally for all messages delivered to applications connected to a FireFly node, across blockchain | .

    "title": "Message",
    "content": "Message is the envelope by which coordinated data exchange can happen between parties in the network. Data is passed by reference in these messages, and a chain of hashes covering the data and the details of the message, provides a verification against tampering. A message is made up of three sections: . | The header - a set of metadata that determines how the message is ordered, who should receive it, and how they should process it | The data - an array of data attachments | Status information - fields that are calculated independently by each node, and hence update as the message makes it way through the system | . Hash . Sections (1) and (2) are fixed once the message is sent, and a hash is generated that provides tamper protection. The hash is a function of the header, and all of the data payloads. Calculated as follows: . | The hash of each Data element is calculated individually | A JSON array of [{\"id\":\"\",\"hash\":\"\"}] is hashed, and that hash is stored in header.datahash | The header is serialized as JSON with the deterministic order (listed below) and hashed . | JSON data is serialized without whitespace to hash it. | The hashing algorithm is SHA-256 | . | . Each node independently calculates the hash, and the hash is included in the manifest of the Batch by the node that sends the message. Because the hash of that batch manifest is included in the blockchain transaction, a message transferred to a node that does not match the original message hash is rejected. Tag . The header.tag tells the processors of the message how it should be processed, and what data they should expect it to contain. If you think of your decentralized application like a state machine, then you need to have a set of well defined transitions that can be performed between states. Each of these transitions that requires off-chain transfer of private data (optionally coordinated with an on-chain transaction) should be expressed as a type of message, with a particular tag. Every copy of the application that runs in the participants of the network should look at this tag to determine what logic to execute against it. Note: For consistency in ordering, the sender should also wait to process the state machine transitions associated with the message they send until it is ordered by the blockchain. They should not consider themselves special because they sent the message, and process it immediately - otherwise they could end up processing it in a different order to other parties in the network that are also processing the message. Topics . The header.topics strings allow you to set the the ordering context for each message you send, and you are strongly encouraged to set it explicitly on every message you send (falling back to the default topic is not recommended). A key difference between blockchain backed decentralized applications and other event-driven applications, is that there is a single source of truth for the order in which things happen. In a multi-party system with off-chain transfer of data as well as on-chain transfer of data, the two sets of data need to be coordinated together. The off-chain transfer might happen at different times, and is subject to the reliability of the parties &amp; network links involved in that off-chain communication. A “stop the world” approach to handling a single piece of missing data is not practical for a high volume production business network. The ordering context is a function of: . | Whether the message is broadcast or private | If it is private, the privacy group associated with the message | The topic of the message | . When an on-chain transaction is detected by FireFly, it can determine the above ordering - noting that privacy is preserved for private messages by masking this ordering context message-by-message with a nonce and the group ID, so that only the participants in that group can decode the ordering context. If a piece of off-chain data is unavailable, then the FireFly node will block only streams of data that are associated with that ordering context. For your application, you should choose the most granular identifier you can for your topic to minimize the scope of any blockage if one item of off-chain data fails to be delivered or is delayed. Some good examples are: . | A business transaction identifier - to ensure all data related to particular business transaction are processed in order | A globally agreed customer identifier - to ensure all data related to a particular business entity are processed in order | . Using multiple topics . There are some advanced scenarios where you need to merge streams of ordered data, so that two previously separately ordered streams of communication (different state machines) are joined together to process a critical decision/transition in a deterministic order. A synchronization point between two otherwise independent streams of communication. To do this, simply specify two topics in the message you sent, and the message will be independently ordered against both of those topics. You will also receive two events for the confirmation of that message, one for each topic. Some examples: . | Agreeing to join two previously separate business transactions with ids 000001 and 000002, by discarding business transaction 000001 as a duplicate . | Specify topics: [\"000001\",\"000002\"] on the special merge message, and then from that point onwards you would only need to specify topics: [\"000002\"]. | . | Agreeing to join two previously separate entities with id1 and id2, into a merged entity with id3. | Specify topics: [\"id1\",\"id2\",\"id3\"] on the special merge message, and then from that point onwards you would only need to specify topics: [\"id3\"]. | . | . Transaction type . By default messages are pinned to the blockchain, within a Batch. For private messages, you can choose to disable this pinning by setting header.txtype: \"unpinned\". Broadcast messages must be pinned to the blockchain. In-line data . When sending a message you can specify the array of Data attachments in-line, as part of the same JSON payload. For example, a minimal broadcast message could be: . { \"data\": [ {\"value\": \"hello world\"} ] } . When you send this message with /api/v1/namespaces/{ns}/messages/broadcast: . | The header will be initialized with the default values, including txtype: \"batch_pin\" | The data[0] entry will be stored as a Data resource | The message will be assembled into a batch and broadcast | . Example . { \"header\": { \"id\": \"4ea27cce-a103-4187-b318-f7b20fd87bf3\", \"cid\": \"00d20cba-76ed-431d-b9ff-f04b4cbee55c\", \"type\": \"private\", \"txtype\": \"batch_pin\", \"author\": \"did:firefly:org/acme\", \"key\": \"0xD53B0294B6a596D404809b1d51D1b4B3d1aD4945\", \"created\": \"2022-05-16T01:23:10Z\", \"namespace\": \"ns1\", \"group\": \"781caa6738a604344ae86ee336ada1b48a404a85e7041cf75b864e50e3b14a22\", \"topics\": [ \"topic1\" ], \"tag\": \"blue_message\", \"datahash\": \"c07be180b147049baced0b6219d9ce7a84ab48f2ca7ca7ae949abb3fe6491b54\" }, \"localNamespace\": \"ns1\", \"state\": \"confirmed\", \"confirmed\": \"2022-05-16T01:23:16Z\", \"data\": [ { \"id\": \"fdf9f118-eb81-4086-a63d-b06715b3bb4e\", \"hash\": \"34cf848d896c83cdf433ea7bd9490c71800b316a96aac3c3a78a42a4c455d67d\" } ] } .

A multi-party system is a class of application empowered by the technology revolution of blockchain digital ledger technology (DLT), and emerging cryptographic proof technologies like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and trusted execution environments (TEEs). By combining these technologies with existing best practice technologies for data security in regulated industries, multi-party systems allow businesses to collaborate in ways previously impossible. Through agreement on a common source of truth, such as the completion of a step in a business process to proceed, or the existence and ownership of a unique asset, businesses can cut out huge inefficiencies in existing multi-party processes. New business and transaction models can be achieved, unlocking value in assets and data that were previously siloed within a single organization. Governance and incentive models can be created to enable secure collaboration in new ways, without compromising the integrity of an individual organization. The technology is most powerful in ecosystems of “coopetition”, where privacy and security requirements are high. Multi-party systems establish new models of trust, with easy to prove outcomes that minimize the need for third party arbitration, and costly investigation into disputes. ",

In a Multi-party FireFly system, entities are able to share data privately as detailed in the “Data Exchange” section. For example, imagine a scenario where there is one healthcare provider and two insurance companies operating in a multi-party system. Insurance company A may send private data to the healthcare provider that insurance company B is not privy to. While insurance company B may not know the contents of data transferred, it may verify that a transfer of data did occur. This validation is all thats needed to maintain an up to date state of the blockchain.

However, the more compute is made fully deterministic via a blockchain consensus algorithm validated by multiple parties beyond those with a business need for access to the data, the more sensitivity needs to be taken to data privacy. Also bear in mind any data that is used in this processing becomes immutable - it can never be deleted. The core constructs of blockchain are a great place to start. Almost every process can be enhanced with pre-built fungible and non-fungible tokens, for example. Maybe it’s to build a token economy that enhances the value parties get from the system, or to encourage healthy participation (and discourage bad behavior). Or maybe it’s to track exactly which party owns a document, asset, or action within a process using NFTs. On top of this you can add advanced tools like digital escrow, signature / threshold based voting on outcomes, and atomic swaps of value/ownership. The investment in building this bespoke on-chain logic is higher than building the off-chain pieces (and there are always some off-chain pieces as we’ve discussed), so it’s about finding the kernel of value the blockchain can provide to differentiate your solution from a centralized database solution. The power provided by deterministic sequencing of events, attested by signatures, and pinned to private data might be sufficient for some cases. In others the token constructs are the key value that differentiates the decentralized ecosystem. Whatever it is, it’s important it is identified and crafted carefully. Note that advanced privacy preserving techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) are gaining traction and hardening in their production readiness and efficiency. Expect these to play an increasing role in the technology stack of multiparty systems (and Hyperledger FireFly) in the future. Learn more in the Deterministic Compute section. ",

Each namespace is an isolated environment within a FireFly runtime, that allows independent configuration of: . | Plugin and infrastructure components | API security | Identity broadcasting | On-chain data indexing | How datatypes, locations of on-chain contrats, etc. should be shared | . They can be thought of in two basic modes: . Multi-party Namespaces . This namespace is shared with one or more other FireFly nodes. It requires three types of communication plugins - blockchain, data exchange, and shared storage. Organization and node identities must be claimed with an identity broadcast when joining the namespace, which establishes credentials for blockchain and off-chain communication. Shared objects can be defined in the namespace (such as datatypes and token pools), and details of them will be implicitly broadcast to other members. This type of namespace is used when multiple parties need to share on- and off-chain data and agree upon the ordering and authenticity of that data. For more information, see the multi-party system overview. Gateway Namespaces . Nothing in this namespace will be shared automatically, and no assumptions are made about whether other parties connected through this namespace are also using Hyperledger FireFly. Plugins for data exchange and shared storage are not supported. If any identities or definitions are created in this namespace, they will be stored in the local database, but will not be shared implicitly outside the node. This type of namespace is mainly used when interacting directly with a blockchain, without assuming that the interaction needs to conform to FireFly’s multi-party system model. ",

    "content": "In order to allow pinning a FireFly message batch with a custom contract transaction, your contract must meet certain criteria. First, any external method of the contract that will be used for associating with off-chain payloads must provide an extra parameter for passing the encoded batch data. This must be the last parameter in the method signature. This convention is chosen partly to align with the Ethereum ERC5750 standard, but should serve as a straightforward guideline for nearly any blockchain. Second, this method must emit a BatchPin event that can be received and parsed by FireFly. Exactly how the data is unpacked and used to emit this event will differ for each blockchain. Ethereum . import \"@hyperledger/firefly-contracts/contracts/IBatchPin.sol\"; contract CustomPin { IBatchPin firefly; function setFireFlyAddress(address addr) external { firefly = IBatchPin(addr); } function sayHello(bytes calldata data) external { require( address(firefly) != address(0), \"CustomPin: FireFly address has not been set\" ); /* do custom things */ firefly.pinBatchData(data); } } . | The method in question will receive packed “batch pin” data in its last method parameter (in the form of ABI-encoded bytes). The method must invoke the pinBatchData method of the FireFly Multiparty Contract and pass along this data payload. It is generally good practice to trigger this as a final step before returning, after the method has performed its own logic. | This also implies that the contract must know the on-chain location of the FireFly Multiparty Contract. How this is achieved is up to your individual implementation - the example above shows exposing a method to set the address. An application may leverage the fact that this location is available by querying the FireFly /status API (under multiparty.contract.location as of FireFly v1.1.0). However, the application must also consider how appropriately secure this functionality, and how to update this location if a multiparty “network action” is used to migrate the network onto a new FireFly multiparty contract. | .

If it is, then that message must receive all off-chain private data and be confirmed before any subsequent messages can be confirmed on the same sequence. So if you use the same topic in every message, then a single failed send on one topic blocks delivery of all messages between those parties, until the missing data arrives. Instead it is best practice to set the topic on your messages to value that identifies an ordered stream of business processing. Some examples: . | A long-running business process instance identifier assigned at initiation | A real-world business transaction identifier used off-chain | The agreed identifier of an asset you are attaching a stream of evidence to | An NFT identifier that is assigned to an asset (digital twin scenarios) | An agreed primary key for a data resource being reconciled between multiple parties | . The topic field is an array, because there are cases (such as merging two identifiers) where you need a message to be deterministically ordered across multiple sequences. However, this is an advanced use case and you are likely to set a single topic on the vast majority of your messages. ",

Here is an example of what the manifest.json looks like: . { \"ethconnect\": { \"image\": \"ghcr.io/hyperledger/firefly-ethconnect\", \"tag\": \"v3.0.4\", \"sha\": \"0b7ce0fb175b5910f401ff576ced809fe6f0b83894277c1cc86a73a2d61c6f41\" }, \"fabconnect\": { \"image\": \"ghcr.io/hyperledger/firefly-fabconnect\", \"tag\": \"v0.9.0\", \"sha\": \"a79a4c66b0a2551d5122d019c15c6426e8cdadd6566ce3cbcb36e008fb7861ca\" }, \"dataexchange-https\": { \"image\": \"ghcr.io/hyperledger/firefly-dataexchange-https\", \"tag\": \"v0.9.0\", \"sha\": \"0de5b1db891a02871505ba5e0507821416d9fa93c96ccb4b1ba2fac45eb37214\" }, \"tokens-erc1155\": { \"image\": \"ghcr.io/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155\", \"tag\": \"v0.9.0-20211019-01\", \"sha\": \"aabc6c483db408896838329dab5f4b9e3c16d1e9fa9fffdb7e1ff05b7b2bbdd4\" } } . NOTE: You can run make manifest in the FireFly core source directory, and a script will run to automatically get the latests non-pre-release version of each of FireFly’s microservices. If you need to use a snapshot or pre-release version you should edit manifest.json file manually, as this script will not fetch those versions. ",

Creating a subscription . Before you can connect to a subscription, you must create it via the REST API. One special case where you do not need to do this, is Ephemeral WebSocket connections (described below). For these you can just connect and immediately start receiving events. When creating a new subscription, you give it a name which is how you will refer to it when you connect. You are also able to specify server-side filtering that should be performed against the event stream, to limit the set of events that are sent to your application. All subscriptions are created within a namespace, and automatically filter events to only those emitted within that namespace. You can create multiple subscriptions for your application, to request different sets of server-side filtering for events. You can then request FireFly to deliver events for both subscriptions over the same WebSocket (if you are using the WebSocket transport). However, delivery order is not assured between two subscriptions. Subscriptions and workload balancing . You can have multiple scaled runtime instances of a single application, all running in parallel. These instances of the application all share a single subscription. Each event is only delivered once to the subscription, regardless of how many instances of your application connect to FireFly. With multiple WebSocket connections active on a single subscription, each event might be delivered to different instance of your application. This means workload is balanced across your instances. However, each event still needs to be acknowledged, so delivery processing order can still be maintained within your application database state. If you have multiple different applications all needing their own copy of the same event, then you need to configure a separate subscription for each application. Pluggable Transports . Hyperledger FireFly has two built-in transports for delivery of events to applications - WebSockets and Webhooks. The event interface is fully pluggable, so you can extend connectivity over an external event bus - such as NATS, Apache Kafka, Rabbit MQ, Redis etc. WebSockets . If your application has a back-end server runtime, then WebSockets are the most popular option for listening to events. WebSockets are well supported by all popular application development frameworks, and are very firewall friendly for connecting applications into your FireFly server. Check out the @hyperledger/firefly-sdk SDK for Node.js applications, and the hyperledger/firefly-common module for Golang applications. These both contain reliable WebSocket clients for your event listeners. A Java SDK is a roadmap item for the community. WebSocket protocol . FireFly has a simple protocol on top of WebSockets: . | Each time you connect/reconnect you need to tell FireFly to start sending you events on a particular subscription. You can do this in two ways (described in detail below): . | Send a WSStart JSON payload | Include a namespace and name query parameter in the URL when you connect, along with query params for other fields of WSStart | . | One you have started your subscription, each event flows from the server, to your application as a JSON Event payload | For each event you receive, you need to send a WSAck payload. | Unless you specified autoack in step (1) | . | . The SDK libraries for FireFly help you ensure you send the start payload each time your WebSocket reconnects. Using start and ack explicitly . Here’s an example websocat command showing an explicit start and ack. $ websocat ws://localhost:5000/ws {\"type\":\"start\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"docexample\"} # ... for each event that arrives here, you send an ack ... {\"type\":\"ack\",\"id\":\"70ed4411-57cf-4ba1-bedb-fe3b4b5fd6b6\"} . When creating your subscription, you can set readahead in order to ask FireFly to stream a number of messages to your application, ahead of receiving the acknowledgements. readahead can be a powerful tool to increase performance, but does require your application to ensure it processes events in the correct order and sends exactly one ack for each event. Auto-starting via URL query and autoack . Here’s an example websocat where we use URL query parameters to avoid the need to send a start JSON payload. We also use autoack so that events just keep flowing from the server. $ websocat \"ws://localhost:5000/ws?namespace=default&amp;name=docexample&amp;autoack\" # ... events just keep arriving here, as the server-side auto-acknowledges # the events as it delivers them to you. Note using autoack means you can miss events in the case of a disconnection, so should not be used for production applications that require at-least-once delivery. Ephemeral WebSocket subscriptions . FireFly WebSockets provide a special option to create a subscription dynamically, that only lasts for as long as you are connected to the server. We call these ephemeral subscriptions. Here’s an example websocat command showing an an ephemeral subscription - notice we don’t specify a name for the subscription, and there is no need to have already created the subscription beforehand. Here we also include an extra query parameter to set a server-side filter, to only include message events. $ websocat \"ws://localhost:5000/ws?namespace=default&amp;ephemeral&amp;autoack&amp;filter.events=message_.*\" {\"type\":\"start\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"docexample\"} # ... for each event that arrives here, you send an ack ... {\"type\":\"ack\",\"id\":\"70ed4411-57cf-4ba1-bedb-fe3b4b5fd6b6\"} . Ephemeral subscriptions are very convenient for experimentation, debugging and monitoring. However, they do not give reliable delivery because you only receive events that occur while you are connected. If you disconnect and reconnect, you will miss all events that happened while your application was not listening. Webhooks . The Webhook transport allows FireFly to make HTTP calls against your application’s API when events matching your subscription are emitted. This means the direction of network connection is from the FireFly server, to the application (the reverse of WebSockets). Conversely it means you don’t need to add any connection management code to your application - just expose and API that FireFly can call to process the events. Webhooks are great for serverless functions (AWS Lambda etc.), integrations with SaaS applications, and calling existing APIs. The FireFly configuration options for a Webhook subscription are very flexible, allowing you to customize your HTTP requests as follows: . | Set the HTTP request details: . | Method, URL, query, headers and input body | . | Wait for a invocation of the back-end service, before acknowledging . | To retry requests to your Webhook on a non-2xx HTTP status code or other error, then you should enable and configure events.webhooks.retry | The event is acknowledged once the request (with any retries), is completed - regardless of whether the outcome was a success or failure. | . | Use fastack to acknowledge against FireFly immediately and make multiple parallel calls to the HTTP API in a fire-and-forget fashion. | Set the HTTP request details dynamically from message_confirmed events: . | Map data out of the first data element in message events | Requires withData to be set on the subscription, in addition to the input.* configuration options | . | Can automatically generate a “reply” message for message_confirmed events: . | Maps the response body of the HTTP call to data in the reply message | Sets the cid and topic in the reply message to match the request | Sets a tag in the reply message, per the configuration, or dynamically based on a field in the input request data. | . | . Example . { \"id\": \"c38d69fd-442e-4d6f-b5a4-bab1411c7fe8\", \"namespace\": \"ns1\", \"name\": \"app1\", \"transport\": \"websockets\", \"filter\": { \"events\": \"^(message_.*|token_.*)$\", \"message\": { \"tag\": \"^(red|blue)$\" }, \"transaction\": {}, \"blockchainevent\": {} }, \"options\": { \"firstEvent\": \"newest\", \"readAhead\": 50 }, \"created\": \"2022-05-16T01:23:15Z\", \"updated\": null } .

The approved “operator” (or “spender”) account might be a smart contract, or another individual. FireFly provides APIs for initiating and tracking approvals, which token connectors integrate with the implementation of the underlying token. The off-chain index maintained in FireFly for allowance allows you to quickly find the most recent allowance event associated with a pair of keys, using the subject field, combined with the active field. When a new Token Approval event is delivered to FireFly Core by the Token Connector, any previous approval for the same subject is marked \"active\": false, and the new approval is marked with \"active\": true . The token connector is responsible for the format of the subject field to reflect the owner / operator (spender) relationship.

    "content": "Token pools are a FireFly construct for describing a set of tokens. The total supply of a particular fungible token, or a group of related non-fungible tokens. The exact definition of a token pool is dependent on the token connector implementation. Check the documentation for your chosen connector implementation to see the detailed options for configuring a new Token Pool. Note that it is very common to use a Token Pool to teach Hyperledger FireFly about an existing token, so that you can start interacting with a token that already exists. Example token pool types . Some examples of how the generic concept of a Token Pool maps to various well-defined Ethereum standards: . | ERC-1155: a single contract instance can efficiently allocate many isolated pools of fungible or non-fungible tokens | ERC-20 / ERC-777: each contract instance represents a single fungible pool of value, e.g. “a coin” | ERC-721: each contract instance represents a single pool of NFTs, each with unique identities within the pool | ERC-1400 / ERC-1410: partially supported in the same manner as ERC-20/ERC-777, but would require new features for working with partitions | . These are provided as examples only - a custom token connector could be backed by any token technology (Ethereum or otherwise) as long as it can support the basic operations described here (create pool, mint, burn, transfer).

    "title": "TokenTransfer",
    "content": "A Token Transfer is created for each transfer of value that happens under a token pool. The transfers form an off-chain audit history (an “index”) of the transactions that have been performed on the blockchain. This historical information cannot be queried directly from the blockchain for most token implementations, because it is inefficient to use the blockchain to store complex data structures like this. So the blockchain simply emits events when state changes, and if you want to be able to query this historical information you need to track it in your own off-chain database. Hyperledger FireFly maintains this index automatically for all Token Pools that are configured. FireFly initiated vs. non-FireFly initiated transfers . There is no requirement at all to use FireFly to initiate transfers in Token Pools that Hyperledger FireFly is aware of. FireFly will listen to and update its audit history and balances for all transfers, regardless of whether they were initiated using a FireFly Supernode or not. So you could for example use Metamask to initiate a transfer directly against an ERC-20/ERC-721 contract directly on your blockchain, and you will see it appear as a transfer. Or initiate a transfer on-chain via another Smart Contract, such as a Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) releasing funds held in digital escrow. Message coordinated transfers . One special feature enabled when using FireFly to initiate transfers, is to coordinate an off-chain data transfer (private or broadcast) with the on-chain transfer of value. This is a powerful tool to allow transfers to have rich metadata associated that is too sensitive (or too large) to include on the blockchain itself. These transfers have a message associated with them, and require a compatible Token Connector and on-chain Smart Contract that allows a data payload to be included as part of the transfer, and to be emitted as part of the transfer event. Examples of how to do this are included in the ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-1155 Token Connector sample smart contracts. Transfer types . There are three primary types of transfer: . | Mint - new tokens come into existence, increasing the total supply of tokens within the pool. The from address will be unset for these transfer types. | Burn - existing tokens are taken out of circulation. The to address will be unset for these transfer types. | Transfer - tokens move from ownership by one account, to another account. The from and to addresses are both set for these type of transfers. | . Note that the key that signed the Transfer transaction might be different to the from account that is the owner of the tokens before the transfer. The Approval resource is used to track which signing accounts (other than the owner) have approval to transfer tokens on the owner’s behalf. Example . { \"type\": \"transfer\", \"pool\": \"1244ecbe-5862-41c3-99ec-4666a18b9dd5\", \"uri\": \"firefly://token/1\", \"connector\": \"erc20_erc721\", \"namespace\": \"ns1\", \"key\": \"0x55860105D6A675dBE6e4d83F67b834377Ba677AD\", \"from\": \"0x55860105D6A675dBE6e4d83F67b834377Ba677AD\", \"to\": \"0x55860105D6A675dBE6e4d83F67b834377Ba677AD\", \"amount\": \"1000000000000000000\", \"protocolId\": \"000000000041/000000/000000\", \"message\": \"780b9b90-e3b0-4510-afac-b4b1f2940b36\", \"messageHash\": \"780204e634364c42779920eddc8d9fecccb33e3607eeac9f53abd1b31184ae4e\", \"created\": \"2022-05-16T01:23:15Z\", \"tx\": { \"type\": \"token_transfer\", \"id\": \"62767ca8-99f9-439c-9deb-d80c6672c158\" }, \"blockchainEvent\": \"b57fcaa2-156e-4c3f-9b0b-ddec9ee25933\" } .

    "content": "FireFly Transactions are a grouping construct for a number of Operations and Events that need to complete or fail as unit. FireFly Transactions are not themselves Blockchain transactions, but in many cases there is exactly one Blockchain transaction associated with each FireFly transaction. Exceptions include unpinned transactions, where there is no blockchain transaction at all. The Blockchain native transaction ID is stored in the FireFly transaction object when it is known. However, the FireFly transaction starts before a Blockchain transaction exists - because reliably submitting the blockchain transaction is one of the operations that is performed inside of the FireFly transaction. The below screenshot from the FireFly Explorer nicely illustrates how multiple operations and events are associated with a FireFly transaction. In this example, the transaction tracking is pinning of a batch of messages stored in IPFS to the blockchain. So there is a Blockchain ID for the transaction - as there is just one Blockchain transaction regardless of how many messages in the batch. There are operations for the submission of that transaction, and the upload of the data to IPFS. Then a corresponding Blockchain Event Received event for the detection of the event from the blockchain smart contract when the transaction was mined, and a Message Confirmed event for each message in the batch (in this case 1). Then here the message was a special Definition message that advertised a new Contract API to all members of the network - so there is a Contract API Confirmed event as well. Each FireFly transaction has a UUID. This UUID is propagated through to all participants in a FireFly transaction. For example in a Token Transfer that is coordinated with an off-chain private Message, the transaction ID is propagated to all parties who are part of that transaction. So the same UUID can be used to find the transaction in the FireFly Explorer of any member who has access to the message. This is possible because hash-pinned off-chain data is associated with that on-chain transfer. However, in the case of a raw ERC-20/ERC-721 transfer (without data), or any other raw Blockchain transaction, the FireFly transaction UUID cannot be propagated - so it will be local on the node that initiated the transaction. Example . { \"id\": \"4e7e0943-4230-4f67-89b6-181adf471edc\", \"namespace\": \"ns1\", \"type\": \"contract_invoke\", \"created\": \"2022-05-16T01:23:15Z\", \"blockchainIds\": [ \"0x34b0327567fefed09ac7b4429549bc609302b08a9cbd8f019a078ec44447593d\" ] } .
